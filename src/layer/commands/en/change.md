# /sw:change — new requirement mid-development

This is the case that breaks most often when done by feel. **The order is not negotiable.**

The requirement comes in `$ARGUMENTS`. If empty, ask for it before doing anything.

## Step 1 — Scope control (before touching a single file)

Read `.un-specweaver/trace.json` and `_bmad-output/prd.md`. Classify the requirement as exactly **one** of:

| Classification | How to recognize it | What follows |
|---|---|---|
| **In scope** | refines an existing FR; adds no new behavior | Step 2 |
| **Scope creep** | new behavior the PRD does not cover, but it fits an existing epic | **Stop and say so.** Wait for a decision. |
| **New epic** | a whole new capability | **Stop.** This goes back to planning, it is not a patch. |

State the classification out loud, citing the specific FR or story that backs it. If torn between
two, pick the more restrictive one and explain why.

**Do not move to Step 2 without user confirmation for anything other than "in scope".**

## Step 2 — Update the source document, not the derived one

If behavior changes, change the PRD/epics with `bmad-correct-course`.

Editing the spec without updating the PRD leaves both lying: the spec says one thing, the PRD
another, and in three weeks nobody knows which wins. The spec is **derived** from epics.md — it
gets regenerated, not hand-edited.

## Step 3 — Regenerate only what is affected

```
npx un-specweaver bridge --only <N.M> --force
```

One `--only` per touched story. **Do not regenerate everything**: you would overwrite in-flight
changes other developers are already working on.

Before running it, check `.un-specweaver/sprint-plan.md`: if the affected story has dependents in
later waves, name which ones are impacted.

## Step 4 — Re-verify

```
npx @fission-ai/openspec validate --all --strict
```

## Step 5 — Record the why

Engram is **optional**, and its memory is **always scoped per project**: `.engram/config.json`
pins the name it saves under and searches in. What you store here does not show up in other
projects, and theirs does not show up here, unless you explicitly ask for a cross-project search
(`all_projects`). Do not do that by default: another project's memory slipping in as if it were
this one's is a hallucination with a citation. If `mem_current_project` does not return
`project_source: "config"`, the binding is missing — run `npx un-specweaver init` before saving.

- **If `engram` is on PATH** → store the decision and its reason there.
- **If it is not** → write it anyway, in the change's `design.md` under `## Decisions`, and
  **tell the user** it went there because Engram is not installed.

What is not acceptable is invoking Engram, nothing happening, and losing the rationale silently.
A "why" that ends up written nowhere is lost just as if it had never been thought.

Store the **decision and its reason**, not the what (that is already in the spec).
What always gets lost is why a scope change was accepted or rejected.

If the change was rejected as scope creep, record it anyway: next time someone proposes it, that
decision saves the entire discussion.
