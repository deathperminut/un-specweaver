# /sw:build — build a change

The change-id comes in `$ARGUMENTS`. If empty, show the current wave from
`.un-specweaver/sprint-plan.md` and ask which.

**This is the only phase that writes product code.** BMAD's building skills are pruned from this
project on purpose: if you look for `bmad-build` or `bmad-agent-dev` and they are missing, that
is not an error.

## Step 0 — Verify the build environment is complete

`npx un-specweaver doctor`. Here the Gentle-AI steps (`gentle-bin`, `gentle-config`) **do**
block: they are the SDD that does the building. If they read missing, fix them with
`npx un-specweaver init` before continuing.

## Step 1 — Verify you can start

Before writing anything:

1. Find the change in `.un-specweaver/sprint-plan.md`. If it declares `depende de` / depends on,
   verify **each** dependency is archived (`openspec/changes/archive/`) or has a complete `tasks.md`.
2. If a dependency is not ready, **stop and say so**. Building on a spec that can still change is
   work that will be thrown away.
3. Read the whole change: `proposal.md`, `specs/**/spec.md`, `tasks.md`.

## Step 2 — Load the right context

```
npx un-specweaver context
```

Lists the artifacts BMAD already produced, at their real paths (they are dated and configurable,
do not guess them). **Load them before designing**:

- **`architecture/ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md`** — technical decisions already made and reviewed.
  **Binding.** SDD design does not relitigate them: it implements them.
- **`ux-designs/DESIGN.md` and `EXPERIENCE.md`** — design and experience. **Binding** for
  everything visual and interactive. The UX-DRs this story covers come from here.
- **`epics.md`** — the story this change came from, with its full criteria.
- **`prds/prd.md`** — only if you need the why behind a requirement.

And also:

- **`docs/architecture-base.md`** — organization constraints; it overrides any default you would
  assume, and overrides ARCHITECTURE-SPINE if they contradict (say so if that happens).
- the code map, **if available** (see below)
- Engram for related prior decisions, **if available** (see below)

Skipping the planning artifacts is this flow's most expensive waste: it means redesigning from
scratch what was already decided, reviewed and approved.

## Code map (graphify)

graphify is **optional**. Resolve in this order and **say which branch you took**:

0. **Read `.un-specweaver/config.json`.** If `preferences.graphify` is `"off"`, the user chose not
   to use it: jump to branch 3 even if installed. The preference overrides detection.

1. **`graphify-out/graph.json` exists** → query it with `/graphify query "<question>"`.
   Do not read files blind when a graph exists.
2. **The graphify skill exists but there is no graph** → offer to build it with `/graphify .`
   before continuing. On large repos this takes a while, so ask instead of assuming.
3. **Neither exists** → fall back to normal exploration (Glob/Grep/Read) and **explicitly warn
   that the map will be less reliable**.

The only serious failure here is the silent one: invoking `/graphify`, nothing happening, and
carrying on as if you had the map. `npx un-specweaver doctor` reports whether it is available and where.

Note: the skill usually lives in `~/.claude/skills/`, so it may exist for Claude Code and not for
OpenCode. Check in the agent you are actually running in; do not assume.

## Step 3 — Build against the spec

**This is the only phase that writes product code.** You build it here, against the contract
that already exists. There are no intermediate phases to orchestrate.

The spec **is** the specification. Every `#### Scenario:` in `specs/**/spec.md` is a test case
that must have a test exercising it. `tasks.md` is the checklist.

1. Implement each task in `tasks.md`, respecting the Step 2 constraints.
2. Write the test for each scenario. A scenario with no test is an unverified requirement.
3. **Do not invent new criteria.** If something is missing, it is missing from the spec, and
   that gets fixed through `/sw:change`, not here.
4. If the change needs deep technical decisions — a new pattern, an external dependency, a
   migration, something cross-cutting — write `design.md` in the change folder before coding.
   **Only if it applies**: OpenSpec asks for it conditionally, not by default.

### Gentle-AI skills that help here

Invoke them by asking in plain language, no ceremony:

- **`work-unit-commits`** — group changes into reviewable commits instead of one blob
- **`judgment-day`** — adversarial review with two judges that contradict each other
- the **`review-readability`**, **`review-reliability`**, **`review-resilience`**,
  **`review-risk`** subagents — each looks through a different lens
- **`branch-pr`** / **`chained-pr`** — PRs with issue-first checks; splits anything over 400 lines

Offer them at close; do not impose them.

## Step 4 — Close out

1. Tick the `tasks.md` boxes that are genuinely done
2. `npx @fission-ai/openspec validate --all --strict`
3. Record the implementation decisions that are not obvious from the code (see "Memory" below)
4. `openspec archive <change-id>` once delivered — that folds the delta into the main spec

## Decision memory (Engram)

Engram is **optional**, and its memory is **always scoped per project**: `.engram/config.json`
pins the name it saves under and searches in. What you store here does not show up in other
projects, and theirs does not show up here, unless you explicitly ask for a cross-project search
(`all_projects`). Do not do that by default: another project's memory slipping in as if it were
this one's is a hallucination with a citation. If `mem_current_project` does not return
`project_source: "config"`, the binding is missing — run `npx un-specweaver init` before saving.

- **If `engram` is on PATH** → store the decision and its reason there.
- **If it is not** → write it anyway, in the change's `design.md` under `## Decisions`, and
  **tell the user** it went there because Engram is not installed.

What is not acceptable is invoking Engram, nothing happening, and losing the rationale silently.
A "why" that ends up written nowhere is lost just as if it had never been thought.

## Boundary

One change at a time. If something outside the change's scope surfaces while building,
**do not fold it in**: note it and route it through `/sw:change`. A change that grows
mid-build is a change that no longer matches its spec.
